    1. Professional Summary 

After graduating high school, I built a strong foundation in video production, accumulating over six years of professional/free-lance experience. During this period, I balanced my creative work with steady entry-level roles in unrelated fields, which provided me with valuable professional experience and discipline. However, my longstanding passion for technology and a desire for a career with stability and growth potential led me to transition into cybersecurity. 

To formalize my technical skills, I entered an intensive 8-month accelerated cybersecurity program, where I have gained hands-on experience with Linux and Windows security tools, network architecture, vulnerability management, incident response, and other critical aspects of cybersecurity. Through this program, I developed a strong analytical mindset and a deep understanding of cybersecurity principles, risk mitigation strategies, and defensive security measures. 

I have since earned my CompTIA Security+ certification (December 2024) and am actively working toward achieving the CySA+ certification (Anticipated April 2025) to further enhance my expertise in cybersecurity analysis, threat detection, and incident response. My goal is to apply my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills to protect organizations from evolving cyber threats while continuously expanding my expertise in the field.

    3. Hands-on Labs and Projects 

[Hands-on Labs] 

- CompTIA Labs 

- Multiple Hands-on Labs completed through official CompTIA learning material.  

 
[Projects] 

LogYoink 

A penetration tool that intends to extract the event log files/system information from a targeted computer. Once extracted, the logs and system information are run through pandas for aggregation and stored in a database using SQLite 3. Once stored, using an automation script the results will be possible attack vectors on the targeted PC based off of the user’s computer habits.  

 

Wood Chopping script for OSRS (Old School RuneScape) 

I have built a simple script for an online video game called ‘Old School RuneScape’ that gives the player the option to automatically “Chop Wood” without the need for user input. Utilizing tools such as PyAutoGUI for automatic mouse clicks, OpenCV for image recognition and Pillow for image processing, I was able to get a functional executable going. While I didn’t see this project fully through, the knowledge I gained from attempting it was invaluable.
